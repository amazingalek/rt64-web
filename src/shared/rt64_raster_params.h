// A WGSL build gives each raster draw its index into instanceRenderIndices as the draw's first instance, which RasterVS
// reads as SV_InstanceID (WGSL's instance_index counts from it) and hands the pixel shaders as a flat varying
// (RasterRenderIndex.hlsli), and leaves renderIndex 0: the push constants are then the same block draw after draw, which
// plume's WebGPU backend binds once in a pass, where a block a draw was a slot of its ring and a setBindGroup on the
// page's thread each. Defined here, beside the block, so that the renderer and the shaders follow the same header: a
// build with its own copy of this file draws by renderIndex in both.
